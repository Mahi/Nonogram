# Nonogram
C++/Qt application for playing [Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), or "Japanese crosswords" as we call them in Finland.

### Nonogram generation

Currently there is no automated way to generate new Nonograms, instead they must be created manually.
Nonograms are simple text files of `1`'s and `0`'s, and the program will then calculate the hint numbers for you.
See `map_working.txt` for an example.
